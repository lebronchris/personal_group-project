Oct.7  We tried to meet up a couple times during this last week. We have decided to work with the CFC - caseload forcast council. We have gotten the data from them to work with, but we are kind of confused on what they want us to do with the data. We had planned to          meet to send them an email showing them a sample data of what we had done with some of the data. We hope things will be more              clear when they email us back.
Oct.21  We had met up with our client who emailed us back. She said that the way the data was cleaned up was perfect for what we were doing for the CFC data. We felt great knowing that we were on the right track with putting the data together the way we did. We were able to put our midterm presentation with confidense knowing that we were on the right track with the project.
Nov.4  I had met up with my group multiple times and had decided to clean up more of the data espacially over the Thanksgiving break. 
Nov.18 We meet up again before the Thanksgiving break and had decided which of us would do which part of the data each of us would clean up. Through most of the time, all we did was clean up data.
Dec.2  We were still meeting up to make sure we were still on track and trying to get the data clean up finished.
Dec.9  All the data was mostly cleaned up and haven't completely met up as much as we did before. It was later decided that I would do the final report and the final presentation is almost complete.
