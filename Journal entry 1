Oct.7  We tried to meet up a couple times during this last week. We have decided to work with the CFC - caseload forcast council. We have        gotten the data from them to work with, but we are kind of confused on what they want us to do with the data. We had planned to          meet to send them an email showing them a sample data of what we had done with some of the data. We hope things will be more              clear when they email us back.
